This is a Project I Used to learn basic things for coding in C++

It is a Simulator that visualizes the breaking distance of a Car. The Projekt uses the SFML 2.6.1 Library to render the used objects.

For correct functionality, the "Auto.png" and the font "Arial.ttf" need to be in the same Folder as the Simulator.exe
